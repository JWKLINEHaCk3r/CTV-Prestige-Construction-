# Final Sample 4 Integration Instructions

## What's Been Added:

1. **New "About" Section**: Added to the main website navigation and homepage
2. **Company Documentation Page**: Created `company-documentation.html` for displaying the document
3. **Responsive Styling**: Added CSS for professional document display
4. **Navigation Integration**: Added "About" link to main navigation menu

## To Complete the Integration:

### Option 1: Extract the Image from Final_Sample_4.html
1. The original file references: `images/Aspose.Words.28ff23b6-15b1-47c9-ad9a-030a762d662e.001.jpeg`
2. You need to locate this image file and copy it to: `/Users/Josephkline/CTV/images/`
3. Once copied, the documentation will display automatically

### Option 2: Use a Different Image
1. Replace the image source in both files:
   - `company-documentation.html` (line 96)
   - Update the path to your preferred image

### Option 3: Convert to PDF or Different Format
1. If you have the original document, you could:
   - Export it as a PDF and link to it
   - Take a screenshot and save it as PNG/JPG
   - Place the new image in the `images/` folder

## Files Modified:
- ✅ `index.html` - Added About section and navigation
- ✅ `styles-fresh.css` - Added document display styling  
- ✅ `company-documentation.html` - New dedicated page for the document
- ✅ `Final_Sample_4.html` - Copied to workspace
- ✅ `images/` directory - Created for document images

## Current Status:
- The integration is complete structurally
- The document page will show a placeholder until the actual image is added
- All styling and navigation is in place and functional

## Next Steps:
1. Add the actual image file to the `images/` directory
2. Test the navigation and document display
3. Adjust styling if needed for the specific document content
