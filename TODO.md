# Project Improvement Plan

## Information Gathered:
- The website is for "CTV Prestige Construction," offering mobile welding and container repair services.
- The main HTML structure is defined in `index.html`, with sections for navigation, services, gallery, and contact.
- The CSS file `styles.css` contains styles for layout, typography, and responsive design.
- JavaScript files are used for dynamic functionality, including loading images and managing assets.

## Plan:
1. **Enhance Accessibility**:
   - Ensure all images have appropriate `alt` attributes for better accessibility.
   - Add ARIA roles where necessary to improve screen reader compatibility.

2. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Minimize CSS and JavaScript files to reduce load times.
   - Implement lazy loading for images in the gallery section to improve initial load performance.

3. **Improve SEO**:
   - Review and enhance meta tags in `index.html` for better search engine optimization.
   - Ensure all images have descriptive filenames and alt text.

4. **Add New Features**:
   - Consider adding a testimonials section to showcase customer feedback.
   - Implement a contact form for easier customer inquiries.

## Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `index.html`: For adding new sections and improving meta tags.
- `styles.css`: For optimizing styles and ensuring responsive design.
- JavaScript files: For implementing new features and optimizing performance.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Review the current implementation and gather feedback from users.
- Implement the proposed changes and test the website for functionality and performance.
- Monitor the website's performance and SEO metrics post-implementation.
